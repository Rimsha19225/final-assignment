    <h1>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah</h1>
    <p><strong>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah</strong> was the founding father of Pakistan and one of the most important figures in the history of the Indian subcontinent. Born on <strong>December 25, 1876</strong>, in Karachi, Jinnah played a critical role in the creation of Pakistan, advocating for the rights of Muslims in British India. His title, <em>Quaid-e-Azam</em>, means <q>Great Leader</q>, reflecting his stature and influence.</p>
    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Jinnah was born into a <strong>Gujarati Muslim family</strong> and received his early education in Karachi and Bombay. He went on to study law at Lincoln's Inn in London. After returning to India, he started his career as a successful lawyer. His early political life was associated with the <abbr title="Indian National Congress">INC</abbr>, where he initially advocated for Hindu-Muslim unity.</p>
    <blockquote><q>With faith, discipline, and selfless devotion to duty, there is nothing worthwhile that you cannot achieve.</q> -Quaid-e-Azam</blockquote>
    <h2>Political Journey</h2>
    <p>In the early part of his political career, Jinnah was known as an ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity. However, with time, he realized the diverging political aspirations of Muslims and Hindus. By the 1930<sup>'</sup>s, Jinnah had emerged as the leader of the <abbr title="All-India Muslim League">AIML</abbr> and advocated for the Two-Nation Theory, which became the foundation for the demand for a separate Muslim state.</p>
    <p>In 1940, the historic Lahore Resolution was passed, calling for the establishment of independent states for Muslims in north-western and eastern zones of India. This was a pivotal moment, and Jinnah's leadership in the movement became more focused and intense.</p>
    <h2>Role in Pakistan Movement</h2>
    <p>Jinnah emphasized the political, social, and religious rights of Muslims in India. He felt that without a separate homeland, the Muslim identity would be compromised. His vision led to the formation of Pakistan on August 14, 1947.</p>
    <p>Jinnah became <strong>Pakistan<sup>'</sup>s first Governor-General</strong> and worked tirelessly for the new nation's establishment. Unfortunately, his health deteriorated soon after, and he passed away on <strong>September 11, 1948</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Ideals and Legacy</h2>
    <p>Quaid-e-Azam believed in constitutionalism, democracy, and rule of law. His vision of Pakistan was that of a modern, progressive state where minorities would have their rights protected, and all citizens would enjoy equal status. He once said:</p>
    <blockquote><q>You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other places of worship in this State of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion, caste, or creedâ€”that has nothing to do with the business of the state.</q></blockquote>
    <p>Quaid-e-Azam is remembered not only for his leadership in the creation of Pakistan but also for his commitment to secularism, human rights, and social justice.</p>

    <p>Jinnah was active in the political scene from the early 20<sp>th</sp> century. He significantly contributed to the Indian political landscape from the early 1900s<sup>th</sup> to 1948. In a post-colonial context, Jinnah's ideas about national identity were profound. He once said,</p>
    <blockquote><q>India and Pakistan are like two brothers but they <del>ARE</del> <ins>are</ins> not identical.</q></blockquote>
    <p>Jinnah's <em>vision</em> for Pakistan was that of a pluralistic society. While his life may have been cut short, his <em>legacy</em> continues to inspire generations.</p>
